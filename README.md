Geospatial Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on geospatial data analysis using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates how to process, visualize, and analyze geospatial data to extract meaningful insights. The project also applies various machine learning models to predict spatial patterns and trends.

Features
Geospatial Data Processing: Load, clean, and prepare geospatial data for analysis.
Data Visualization: Create maps and spatial visualizations to explore geographic patterns.
Machine Learning Models: Train and evaluate models to predict trends or spatial outcomes based on geospatial data.
Geospatial Libraries: Use popular Python libraries such as geopandas and shapely for geospatial processing.
Use Cases
Predictive Modeling: Identify trends and make predictions based on geographical features.
Urban Planning: Analyze urban growth patterns and make predictions for future development.
Environmental Monitoring: Study the effects of environmental factors like pollution, forest cover, or rainfall across regions.
Technologies & Libraries
Python: The core programming language used for analysis.
GeoPandas: For geospatial data manipulation.
Matplotlib & Folium: To visualize geospatial data and create interactive maps.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model training.
Shapely: For geometric operations on spatial data.
Pyproj: For handling projections and coordinate transformations.
